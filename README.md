# Client-Server-Development

•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When I create programs like the one for project one, I try to break down each step to its most simple components using methods for each part. For example, during project one I create methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting. The advantage of working like this is anyone wanting to maintain or change the program will have an easier time understanding the program. This CRUD Python module can be used in the future to help not just Grazioso Salvare but the Austin Animal Center by allowing them to create their own Dash file. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When working on a program and a problem comes up, I check for errors in the code missing brackets and etc. If this does not fix the problem, I look at each step of the program. Stepping through the program line by line seeing how the values change as I go. If I find anything wrong, I look closely at the line where the program failed to work as it should. My approach didn’t change during the development of project because each time there was a problem, I solved it the same way.

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists or developers create programs and software for clients. The reason creating programs is important is because without developers most small businesses could not sale their wares around the world without them. By creating programs like project 2, this helps companies like Grazioso Salvare to find resources faster and easier allowing more dogs to be found for their training.
